# Distribution of workload over time
#
# The way to obtain each hourly portion is calculated by
# dividing the total divided by the total number of
# allocated http requests.
# For more details,
# * All hours up to 0-23 must be present
# * If you want to mean 0%, you only need to specify (e.g., 11: ,)
# * Characters are meaningless and use only length. Hence,
#   you can use any of the available characters
